# Git Infrastructure Setup Test

Enterprise-grade Git workflow infrastructure with automated deployments, branch protection, and squash merge support.

## üöÄ Quick Start

This repository demonstrates a complete Git workflow setup for:
- Feature development with branch naming conventions
- Automated staging promotions
- Production releases with squash merge strategy
- Commit analysis and PR automation

## üîÑ Workflow Overview

```
feature/branch ‚Üí develop ‚Üí staging ‚Üí main
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì         ‚Üì        ‚Üì
   PR Review    Auto PR    Squash    Release
                           Merge
                             ‚Üì
                        Main ‚Üí Staging
                           (sync)
```

### Branch Strategy
- **feature/**, **bugfix/**, **hotfix/** - Feature development branches
- **develop** - Integration branch (not yet implemented)
- **staging** - Pre-production testing environment
- **main** - Production branch

### Key Workflows
1. **Branch Naming Check** - Validates branch naming conventions
2. **Auto Promote to Production** - Creates staging‚Üímain PRs
3. **Production Deploy** - Deploys on merge to main
4. **Staging Deploy** - Deploys on push to staging

## üéØ Critical: Squash Merge Pattern

**Important:** This repository uses squash merges for production releases. After each merge to main:

1. ‚úÖ Merge the PR using "Squash and merge"
2. ‚úÖ **Immediately** merge main back into staging:
   ```bash
   git checkout staging
   git merge main -m "Sync: Merge main into staging after release"
   git push origin staging
   ```

**Why?** This creates a synchronization point that allows accurate commit tracking for future releases.

See [SQUASH_MERGE_WORKFLOW.md](SQUASH_MERGE_WORKFLOW.md) for detailed explanation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflows

### Core Workflows
- `.github/workflows/branch-naming-check.yml` - Enforces branch naming
- `.github/workflows/staging-deploy.yml` - Deploys to staging
- `.github/workflows/production-deploy.yml` - Deploys to production

### Automation Workflows
- `.github/workflows/production-release.yml` - Creates production promotion PRs
- `.github/workflows/staging-pr-analysis.yml` - Analyzes staging PRs
- `.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml` - Creates release tags

## üìä Recent Improvements

### Fixed Commit Analysis (Oct 2025)

**Problem:** Production release workflow incorrectly showed 18 already-merged commits as new.

**Root Cause:** After squash merging, the workflow couldn't track which commits were already in main.

**Solution:** Changed to sync-point-based tracking using merge commits where main is merged back into staging.

**Result:** Now correctly identifies only 5 new commits instead of 18.

See [POST_FIX_CHECKLIST.md](POST_FIX_CHECKLIST.md) for actions needed.

## üß™ Testing

Run the workflow testing script:

```bash
./scripts/test-git-workflow.sh
```

This validates:
- Branch naming conventions
- Workflow files existence
- Deployment script simulation
- Optional full workflow testing

## üìã Checklist for New Deployments

- [ ] Configure branch protection rules (see BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md)
- [ ] Set up required status checks
- [ ] Configure deployment secrets/environments
- [ ] Update deployment scripts with actual commands
- [ ] Test the complete workflow with a feature branch
- [ ] Ensure main‚Üístaging sync after first production release

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Workflow shows too many commits
- Check when main was last merged into staging
- Merge main into staging to create a sync point

### Branch naming check fails
- Use format: `feature/description`, `bugfix/description`, or `hotfix/description`
- Use lowercase and hyphens only

### Can't merge to protected branch
- Ensure required status checks pass
- Get required number of approvals
- Resolve all conversations

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make changes and commit: `git commit -m "feat: your feature"`
3. Push and create PR: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
4. Ensure branch naming check passes
5. Get required approvals
6. Merge using appropriate method (squash for main, regular for staging)

## üìû Support

- Check documentation in the root directory
- Review workflow files for inline comments
- See troubleshooting sections in guides
- File an issue for unexpected behavior
